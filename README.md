# transducers2025 template

How much do I hate MSWord?  Enough to spend a day making a template in LaTeX.


This work is a quick and dirty hack to get a template that works for Transducers 2025. The motivation is that I couldn't get MSWord to do what I wanted, and I honestly have no idea how anyone uses that tool.  Particularly with references.  I used the IEEE conference template as a basis and then overrode everything.


The only section that I didn't put in the template was this section, which I followed:

• TITLE:	12 POINTS, BOLD, ALL CAPITALS

• Section Header:	11 points, bold, underlined

• Text body:	11 points, regular; all paragraphs indented 0.25”

• Figure captions:	10 points, italic

• Table captions:	10 points, italic

• References:	11 points, regular, numbered

In order to get the word count, you need to run ./wordcount.sh, and if you have the tools, it'll magically generate the word count field.
